# asciipaint-gif-viewer

This application is an AutoIT sample leveraging the capabilities of the *Consoul* library (see documentation link below).

The Tuttenkammen image displayed by this AutoIT script is produced by code generated with [AsciiPaint](https://github.com/francescofoti/asciipaint).

Please see additional documentation on the [consoul.net website here](https://consoul.net/docs/autoit/).

Please note that the Matrix like gif picture included here (matrix-katana-bkgnd.gif) may be subject to another license or author rights than the ones provided by the GNU v2 governing this project.
I tried to find back (google) where I did pick up this gif but couldn't, so I'm a bit lost at what I'm allowed to do here. I kept the image in the project so you can experience the result for yourself, but I would advice not to redistribute it and will remove it if required to do so.
If you find the author or where the image is hosted, please advice, so I can do the right thing.
